Also expect about a 3 hr experience - most in which there is no air conditioning and the chapel is VeRY crowded with no reasonable exit. Do not go if you are claustrophobic!\nOtherwise this is a fantastic experience. Just long and hot... and we made the hike to meet the address listed which was exhausting and unnecessary.",

It also would have been nice to have a warning as to how expensive the basic restaurants are that are near St. Peter\u2019s. Simple lunch cost 120 Euros...... rediculous.",

		"message": "I loved my visit to the Vatican museum. I thought it as going to be all about the Renaissance, and it was, but it was much more. The teasing way they presented contemporary art on the last leg of the trek through history and archaeology to the Sistine Chapel was a surprise. The signs kept saying Capella Sistina but there was hall after hall of 20th and 21st-century art that was surprising and beautiful. There was art from many of the greats and it was inspiring to see them take on traditional religious subjects in new and exciting ways. Of course, when you enter the Sistine everything else in your life seems small and insignificant, including the art you\u0026#039;ve just been looking at for half an hour or more. But when I looked back I was impressed because this is the art I can and do myself.",

We took a picnic and plenty of water and ate outside in the gardens. There are some long galleries with amazing ceilings but as we approached the Sistene Chapel the crowd got very congested. The Chapel ceiling is a wonder to behold. Overall An enjoyable visit.",
